      value: "The night of the gala, I arrived to work at the conservatory as the
        sun was setting. The glass building appeared alien, as though it had landed
        on the hill to capture specimens of the waning December light. Tom dropped
        me off at the back entrance. I was late, but before he would let me out of
        the car, he made me put his cock in my mouth. I didn\u2019t have to do anything
        with it. I think he just wanted to know it had been there, and that knowledge
        enabled him to drive away.\r\n\r\nThe gala was a fundraising affair for the
        botanical garden, a schmoozy silent auction and party for a who\u2019s who
        of the city\u2019s horticultural philanthropists. We had been preparing for
        months. The approach to the conservatory\u2019s front doors was encrusted
        in twinkling lights, and out back they\u2019d erected a massive tent. Inside
        the headhouse, holiday decorations were everywhere, packing material and
        broken ornaments scattered among the pots and gardening tools. The air bore
        the distinctive odor of our corpse flower, the massive Amorphophallus titanium.
        It was blooming, but we\u2019d hidden it back here. No matter how rare and
        fascinating the plant might be, no one wanted to drink bubbly flutes of Prosecco
        and slow dance to Christmas jazz next to a fly-pollinated flower that reeked
        of rotten meat.\r\n\r\nI threw my backpack on the potting station and looked
        around for my magnetic nametag. Behind me, the doors to the glass house interior
        opened. The conservatory horticulturist, Mary Margaret, appeared. She was
        in her 50s, only a few years younger than my mother, and usually wore denim
        shorts, plus a T-shirt with the garden\u2019s logo on the front. But tonight
        was different. Her body was sheathed in a synthetic black shift, and a multicolored
        beaded belt gave her a waist. She teetered on a pair of worn black pumps
        with kitten heels. Her glasses, ordinarily green with grime, were clean.
        It felt like I was seeing her eyes for the first time.\r\n\r\nShe said, \u201CAlison.
        What took you so long?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI had trouble deciding what to
        wear,\u201D I replied.\r\n\r\nI had ceased to expect she would reprimand
        me. But I still wanted her to, somehow. I thought it would feel good\u2014like
        instead of this ambiguity, I could just hate her. But her face was dim. She
        was somewhere far away, searching for an entry point into her own suffering.
        \u201CAfter the divorce,\u201D she said finally, \u201Cthis dress was one
        of the only nice things I had left.\u201D\r\n\r\nI\u2019d been abducted by
        the conservatory, and Mary Margaret, when the weather got cold. She needed
        someone to help transform the glass house into a sparkling holiday wonderland,
        she said, but every other member of the staff was \u201Cbusy\u201D whenever
        she came around. They did hate her, I realized. When you spend hours pruning
        and weeding, there\u2019s not much to keep you entertained besides gossip.
        And they talked about Mary Margaret often, her monstrous tendencies the default
        subject when there was nothing else to say. I\u2019d started working here
        in August, so as the newest\u2014and the youngest\u2014gardener, I had no
        defenses against her. As the rest of the staff planned the spring displays,
        took out dead branches, and sipped coffee poured from a steaming carafe at
        lunch, I found myself behind the glass.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll need to
        greet people at the front doors,\u201D Mary Margaret said. \u201CPoint them
        in the direction of the tent, and if they need, show them where the bathroom
        is. Once everyone\u2019s safe inside the tent, just do the rounds and keep
        the floor clean. We had a woman last year who slipped on a patch of water
        under the staghorn fern, and broke her clavicle. That was fun.\u201D She
        laughed, and there was a hard joy in it. I imagined her standing behind the
        glass walls a year ago, watching the ambulance approach with lusty glee.\r\n\r\nI
        left the headhouse, exiting into the doors that let out into the back room
        of the conservatory. As the doors swung shut behind me, the air changed.
        Out here, the smell was green and rich, a mossy jungle embedded with the
        scents of tropical flowers. It was warm, almost hot. Across the way the doors
        to the gala tent gaped open. Within, catering staff hurried back and forth,
        carrying chairs, adjusting lights, and fanning cocktail napkins out into
        feathered piles. The string quartet was setting up on the small raised stage
        at the back of the tent. In college, I had hated parties. But this one, the
        climax of our conservatory transformation, excited me. Yes, it was another
        night of work, and I had to come back in the morning, too. But I was nervy
        with anticipation, imagining guests flowing into this warmly lit interior,
        wine glasses tinkling, their laughter overwriting the usual white noise of
        the conservatory\u2019s churning fans, bubbling artificial pools, and the
        deep generator hum emanating from nowhere and everywhere all at once.\r\n\r\nI
        headed for my post at the front. Our conservatory was shaped like an upside-down
        Christian cross. Each transept housed a separate doored wing, closed off
        to preserve different air and temperature levels. Spanish moss dangled from
        tree limbs in the west wing, bearding down over plantings of tropical ginger.
        The centerpiece in that wing was an orchid wall whose flowers cascaded over
        a reflection pool. My mother worked in the orchid greenhouse that supplied
        these unusual specimens, and she\u2019d helped me get the job here. I should
        have been in college this week, working on finals. But I had stopped after
        only two years. My parents said it would be good for me to take a break from
        playing video games and get some exercise. It would help me figure out what
        to do after finishing what my mom called \u201Cyour year off.\u201D\r"

      value: "The night of the gala, I arrived to work at the conservatory as the
        sun was setting. The glass building appeared alien, as though it had landed
        on the hill to capture specimens of the waning December light. Tom dropped
        me off at the back entrance. I was late, but before he would let me out of
        the car, he made me put his cock in my mouth. I didn\u2019t have to do anything
        with it. I think he just wanted to know it had been there, and that knowledge
        enabled him to drive away.\r\n\r\nThe gala was a fundraising affair for the
        botanical garden, a schmoozy silent auction and party for a who\u2019s who
        of the city\u2019s horticultural philanthropists. We had been preparing for
        months. The approach to the conservatory\u2019s front doors was encrusted
        in twinkling lights, and out back they\u2019d erected a massive tent. Inside
        the headhouse, holiday decorations were everywhere, packing material and
        broken ornaments scattered among the pots and gardening tools. The air bore
        the distinctive odor of our corpse flower, the massive Amorphophallus titanium.
        It was blooming, but we\u2019d hidden it back here. No matter how rare and
        fascinating the plant might be, no one wanted to drink bubbly flutes of Prosecco
        and slow dance to Christmas jazz next to a fly-pollinated flower that reeked
        of rotten meat.\r\n\r\nI threw my backpack on the potting station and looked
        around for my magnetic nametag. Behind me, the doors to the glass house interior
        opened. The conservatory horticulturist, Mary Margaret, appeared. She was
        in her 50s, only a few years younger than my mother, and usually wore denim
        shorts, plus a T-shirt with the garden\u2019s logo on the front. But tonight
        was different. Her body was sheathed in a synthetic black shift, and a multicolored
        beaded belt gave her a waist. She teetered on a pair of worn black pumps
        with kitten heels. Her glasses, ordinarily green with grime, were clean.
        It felt like I was seeing her eyes for the first time.\r\n\r\nShe said, \u201CAlison.
        What took you so long?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI had trouble deciding what to
        wear,\u201D I replied.\r\n\r\nI had ceased to expect she would reprimand
        me. But I still wanted her to, somehow. I thought it would feel good\u2014like
        instead of this ambiguity, I could just hate her. But her face was dim. She
        was somewhere far away, searching for an entry point into her own suffering.
        \u201CAfter the divorce,\u201D she said finally, \u201Cthis dress was one
        of the only nice things I had left.\u201D\r\n\r\nI\u2019d been abducted by
        the conservatory, and Mary Margaret, when the weather got cold. She needed
        someone to help transform the glass house into a sparkling holiday wonderland,
        she said, but every other member of the staff was \u201Cbusy\u201D whenever
        she came around. They did hate her, I realized. When you spend hours pruning
        and weeding, there\u2019s not much to keep you entertained besides gossip.
        And they talked about Mary Margaret often, her monstrous tendencies the default
        subject when there was nothing else to say. I\u2019d started working here
        in August, so as the newest\u2014and the youngest\u2014gardener, I had no
        defenses against her. As the rest of the staff planned the spring displays,
        took out dead branches, and sipped coffee poured from a steaming carafe at
        lunch, I found myself behind the glass.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll need to
        greet people at the front doors,\u201D Mary Margaret said. \u201CPoint them
        in the direction of the tent, and if they need, show them where the bathroom
        is. Once everyone\u2019s safe inside the tent, just do the rounds and keep
        the floor clean. We had a woman last year who slipped on a patch of water
        under the staghorn fern, and broke her clavicle. That was fun.\u201D She
        laughed, and there was a hard joy in it. I imagined her standing behind the
        glass walls a year ago, watching the ambulance approach with lusty glee.\r\n\r\nI
        left the headhouse, exiting into the doors that let out into the back room
        of the conservatory. As the doors swung shut behind me, the air changed.
        Out here, the smell was green and rich, a mossy jungle embedded with the
        scents of tropical flowers. It was warm, almost hot. Across the way the doors
        to the gala tent gaped open. Within, catering staff hurried back and forth,
        carrying chairs, adjusting lights, and fanning cocktail napkins out into
        feathered piles. The string quartet was setting up on the small raised stage
        at the back of the tent. In college, I had hated parties. But this one, the
        climax of our conservatory transformation, excited me. Yes, it was another
        night of work, and I had to come back in the morning, too. But I was nervy
        with anticipation, imagining guests flowing into this warmly lit interior,
        wine glasses tinkling, their laughter overwriting the usual white noise of
        the conservatory\u2019s churning fans, bubbling artificial pools, and the
        deep generator hum emanating from nowhere and everywhere all at once.\r"

      value: "The night of the gala, I arrived to work at the conservatory as the
        sun was setting. The glass building appeared alien, as though it had landed
        on the hill to capture specimens of the waning December light. Tom dropped
        me off at the back entrance. I was late, but before he would let me out of
        the car, he made me put his cock in my mouth. I didn\u2019t have to do anything
        with it. I think he just wanted to know it had been there, and that knowledge
        enabled him to drive away.\r\n\r\nThe gala was a fundraising affair for the
        botanical garden, a schmoozy silent auction and party for a who\u2019s who
        of the city\u2019s horticultural philanthropists. We had been preparing for
        months. The approach to the conservatory\u2019s front doors was encrusted
        in twinkling lights, and out back they\u2019d erected a massive tent. Inside
        the headhouse, holiday decorations were everywhere, packing material and
        broken ornaments scattered among the pots and gardening tools. The air bore
        the distinctive odor of our corpse flower, the massive Amorphophallus titanium.
        It was blooming, but we\u2019d hidden it back here. No matter how rare and
        fascinating the plant might be, no one wanted to drink bubbly flutes of Prosecco
        and slow dance to Christmas jazz next to a fly-pollinated flower that reeked
        of rotten meat.\r\n\r\nI threw my backpack on the potting station and looked
        around for my magnetic nametag. Behind me, the doors to the glass house interior
        opened. The conservatory horticulturist, Mary Margaret, appeared. She was
        in her 50s, only a few years younger than my mother, and usually wore denim
        shorts, plus a T-shirt with the garden\u2019s logo on the front. But tonight
        was different. Her body was sheathed in a synthetic black shift, and a multicolored
        beaded belt gave her a waist. She teetered on a pair of worn black pumps
        with kitten heels. Her glasses, ordinarily green with grime, were clean.
        It felt like I was seeing her eyes for the first time.\r\n\r\nShe said, \u201CAlison.
        What took you so long?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI had trouble deciding what to
        wear,\u201D I replied.\r\n\r\nI had ceased to expect she would reprimand
        me. But I still wanted her to, somehow. I thought it would feel good\u2014like
        instead of this ambiguity, I could just hate her. But her face was dim. She
        was somewhere far away, searching for an entry point into her own suffering.
        \u201CAfter the divorce,\u201D she said finally, \u201Cthis dress was one
        of the only nice things I had left.\u201D\r\n\r\nI\u2019d been abducted by
        the conservatory, and Mary Margaret, when the weather got cold. She needed
        someone to help transform the glass house into a sparkling holiday wonderland,
        she said, but every other member of the staff was \u201Cbusy\u201D whenever
        she came around. They did hate her, I realized. When you spend hours pruning
        and weeding, there\u2019s not much to keep you entertained besides gossip.
        And they talked about Mary Margaret often, her monstrous tendencies the default
        subject when there was nothing else to say. I\u2019d started working here
        in August, so as the newest\u2014and the youngest\u2014gardener, I had no
        defenses against her. As the rest of the staff planned the spring displays,
        took out dead branches, and sipped coffee poured from a steaming carafe at
        lunch, I found myself behind the glass.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll need to
        greet people at the front doors,\u201D Mary Margaret said. \u201CPoint them
        in the direction of the tent, and if they need, show them where the bathroom
        is. Once everyone\u2019s safe inside the tent, just do the rounds and keep
        the floor clean. We had a woman last year who slipped on a patch of water
        under the staghorn fern, and broke her clavicle. That was fun.\u201D She
        laughed, and there was a hard joy in it. I imagined her standing behind the
        glass walls a year ago, watching the ambulance approach with lusty glee.\r\n\r\nI
        left the headhouse, exiting into the doors that let out into the back room
        of the conservatory. As the doors swung shut behind me, the air changed.
        Out here, the smell was green and rich, a mossy jungle embedded with the
        scents of tropical flowers. It was warm, almost hot. Across the way the doors
        to the gala tent gaped open. Within, catering staff hurried back and forth,
        carrying chairs, adjusting lights, and fanning cocktail napkins out into
        feathered piles. The string quartet was setting up on the small raised stage
        at the back of the tent. In college, I had hated parties. But this one, the
        climax of our conservatory transformation, excited me. Yes, it was another
        night of work, and I had to come back in the morning, too. But I was nervy
        with anticipation, imagining guests flowing into this warmly lit interior,
        wine glasses tinkling, their laughter overwriting the usual white noise of
        the conservatory\u2019s churning fans, bubbling artificial pools, and the
        deep generator hum emanating from nowhere and everywhere all at once.\r\n\r\nI
        headed for my post at the front. Our conservatory was shaped like an upside-down
        Christian cross. Each transept housed a separate doored wing, closed off
        to preserve different air and temperature levels. Spanish moss dangled from
        tree limbs in the west wing, bearding down over plantings of tropical ginger.
        The centerpiece in that wing was an orchid wall whose flowers cascaded over
        a reflection pool. My mother worked in the orchid greenhouse that supplied
        these unusual specimens, and she\u2019d helped me get the job here. I should
        have been in college this week, working on finals. But I had stopped after
        only two years."
